so many people have asked me how long to cook tenderloins if they have ""more than one"" to cook, i wanted to give a simple response.  answer:  so long as the tenderloins are not touching each other, cook 3 or 4 individual tenderloins for the same amount of time as if you were cooking one.  remember, each tenderloin is cooking in its own separate space.  example:  if cooking three 1-pound tenderloins, cook them only 5-1/5 minutes total.   this makes it a great entree recipe when having a dinner party for 8-12 people, or more.

i have found that you need to follow the directions *exactly* to get the best cookies. not using real butter or all brown sugar, not beating the eggs in one at a time, not baking them at a higher temp than the ""traditional"" recipe, all make a difference in the end result. 

i have also found that land o' lake butter makes a better cookie than some generic brand butter. don't let the butter sit out too long. it needs to soften but if it sits until the moisture starts to separate from the butter, it is too soft and it will affect the resulting cookies. if that happens, refrigerate the dough for about an hour to help them not spread as much. it also helps to use the mixer on the dough in between batches going into the oven. it helps keep the dough from starting to separate if it is a warm day. 

another thing i've learned is you have to make sure there is plenty of circulation in your oven. when i moved, my cookies started turning out flat again. i finally realized that my oven was smaller at the new house and when i switched to smaller cookie sheets, my cookies turned out perfectly!","['all-purpose flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'real butter', 'shortening', 'brown sugar', 'vanilla', 'eggs', 'semi-sweet chocolate chips', 'nuts']",10,209,4.22
